Objective

In this challenge, we practice declaring variables using the let and const keywords. Check out the attached tutorial for more details.

Task

Declare a constant variable, , and assign it the value Math.PI. You will not pass this challenge unless the variable is declared as a constant and named PI (uppercase).
Read a number, , denoting the radius of a circle from stdin.
Use  and  to calculate the  and  of a circle having radius .
Print  as the first line of output and print  as the second line of output.
*/

function main() {
    // Write your code here. Read input using 'readLine()' and print output using 'console.log()'.
    const PI = Math.PI;
    const RADIO = readLine();
    const AREA = PI * Math.pow(RADIO, 2);
    const PERIMETRO = 2 * PI * RADIO;

    
    // Print the area of the circle:
    console.log(AREA);
    // Print the perimeter of the circle:
    console.log(PERIMETRO);
}
